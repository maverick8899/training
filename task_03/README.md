# Automation Scripts
### 1. **Check-server.sh**

**Purpose:**  
The `check_server.sh` script is designed to perform a comprehensive check of the server it is run on. It checks the status of the server, including all critical aspects that an admin needs to monitor to ensure the server is functioning properly.

**What it checks:**

-   **System uptime**: Ensures the server has been running without interruptions.
-   **Disk usage**: Checks for sufficient free space and any disk-related issues.
-   **Memory usage**: Monitors RAM usage to prevent any potential out-of-memory errors.
-   **CPU load**: Ensures the CPU is not overburdened, which can degrade performance.
-   **Network connectivity**: Confirms that the server can connect to the internet or other internal servers.
-   **Running services**: Verifies that essential services (e.g., web server, database) are running. 
-   **Disk I/O performance**: Refers to the speed and efficiency with which a system can read from or write data to disk storage, impacting overall system responsiveness and performance.
-   **Firewall status**: Ensures the firewall is configured correctly.
-   **Ports Listening**: Check ports which system are listening

**Use case:**  
Run this script to check the health and status of the current server (check itself). It’s particularly useful for routine health checks or as part of a server monitoring process.

## 2. **Remote-copy-file.sh**

**Purpose:**  
`remote_copy.sh` simplifies the process of copying files between servers. Whether it’s a log file, a Java `.jar` file, a `.zip`, or `.tar.gz` archive, this script uses `scp` or other synchronization methods to efficiently transfer files.

**Key features:**

-   Copy files or directories to remote servers via `scp`.
-   Supports compressed files like `.zip`, `.tar.gz`, or `.jar`.
-   Can handle one or multiple target servers.

**Use case:**  
This script is designed for frequent file transfers to remote servers, such as during application deployments or when moving logs between environments.

----------

## 3. **Remote-control.sh**

**Purpose:**  
`remote_control.sh` is used to execute commands or scripts on remote servers. It is especially helpful when you need to run the same command on multiple servers at once.

**Key features:**

-   Run shell commands or entire scripts remotely on multiple servers.
-   Servers are specified in an `inventory` file or input string, which contains a list of server IPs or hostnames.
-   Execute commands over SSH, enabling centralized server control.
-   Install random module (eg: Nginx,... )

**Use case:**  
Ideal for managing a fleet of servers (e.g., when you need to restart services, deploy configurations, or run maintenance scripts across many servers simultaneously).

----------

## 4. **Autoping.sh**

**Purpose:**  
`autoping.sh` continuously monitors the connectivity to a given server (or list of servers) by pinging the IP address and testing port connectivity with `telnet` or `nc`. It helps track network issues, which is particularly useful when diagnosing intermittent connectivity failures.

**Key features:**

-   Pings a list of IPs at regular intervals (every minute by default).
-   Tests the connectivity to specific ports.
-   Can be used to log connection failures for later review.

**Use case:**  
This script is invaluable when you are running long-running pipelines or processes and want to ensure network stability over time. If a connection drops overnight and causes a job to fail, the logs generated by this script provide proof of the failure, helping to diagnose issues with the network team or developers.
